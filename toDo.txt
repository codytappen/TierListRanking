Create a generalizable version of this algorithm (one which can simply take a list of win loss as a 2d array and do the calculations (using percentage)

Make a gradient boost decission tree with simulated data for rock/paper/scissors/well. Make sure that it ends up generally agreeing with our ranking algorithm

Use Smash.gg's API to create matchup win/loss ratios (matchup charts) based on character results

Use Smash.gg API to build a large training data set for the GDB, and train it.

Compare findings with lots of tweeks.

Manually build a GDB in Python, convert our code to use that

Attempt to formally prove and understand the work 

Ask for guidance about further research into this field w/ qualified prof
